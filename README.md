## 📊 Description of Scripts

- `aiken_v_analysis.ipynb`: Computes Aiken’s V coefficient and confidence intervals to assess content validity of items, based on expert ratings.
- `Psychometric_Properties.R`: Conducts exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and computes psychometric indicators such as reliability.

|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `data_Aiken_Tutoring.csv` | Expert item ratings for Aiken’s V content validity analysis.               |
| `data_participants.csv`   | Full anonymized dataset from university students who completed the ATPS.   |
| `demo_judges.csv`         | Sociodemographic information of the expert judges.                         |

All datasets are fully anonymized and comply with ethical and institutional research guidelines.

## 📦 Requirements

To reproduce the analyses, ensure you have the following:

### 🐍 Python (for content validity)
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `tabulate`

Install using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib tabulate
```

### 🧠 R (for factor analysis)
```r
install.packages(c(
  "tidyverse", "readxl", "gtsummary", "lavaan", "psych",
  "nFactors", "semTools", "EGAnet", "corrplot"
))
```

## ▶️ How to Reproduce the Analyses

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place the `/data` folder in your working directory.
3. Run the following scripts in order:

   1. `aiken_v_analysis.ipynb` (Python): analyzes content validity.
   2. `Psychometric_Properties.R` (R): conducts EFA, CFA, and reliability analysis.
